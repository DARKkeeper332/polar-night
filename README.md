Well... not any, this theme is tailor-made for **Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity, and Gnome 3.10**

**Q**: _No support for other DEs/WMs?_

**A**: _That's right - do one thing, and do it well_ :p

###### now, the mod


- Obviously - colorscheme customizations to gtk2, gtk3, and Unity - it is now dark
- This theme contains a workaround to get rid of a bug that clashes with overlay scrollbars and draws black backgrounds in tabbed Nautilus and Gedit windows, and in some Ubuntu dialogues
- Nautilus specific changes, to buttons, linked buttons; Unity window decorations changes
- The GTK2 is now a simple gtkrc - borderless input fields in Firefox, etc., from the original didn't quite do it for me
